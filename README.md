# ByteConverter :floppy_disk: :sparkles:

## Intro :mag:
ByteConverter is a powerful yet simple tool designed to convert binary files (like images) into C++ header arrays. This is particularly useful for embedding resources directly into your code. :computer:

## Getting Started :rocket:
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Usage
Run the script and follow the on-screen prompts:
`python main.py`

## How It Works :gear:
ByteConverter reads the binary content of the specified input file and converts it into a C++ header file. The output file contains an array of bytes representing the file data, along with its size. This is particularly useful for embedding images or other resources directly into C++ applications.
